# RotaryEncoder
Based on Oleg Mazurov's code for rotary encoder interrupt service routines for AVR micros here 
https://chome.nerpa.tech/mcu/reading-rotary-encoder-on-arduino/

and using interrupts 
https://chome.nerpa.tech/mcu/rotary-encoder-interrupt-service-routine-for-avr-micros/

This example does not use the port read method. Tested with Nano and ESP32. Note that both encoder A and B pins must be connected to interrupt enabled pins
